# Cocomo

The Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is a procedural software cost estimation model.  
It was developed by Barry W. Boehm in 1981 to calculate the development effort of a software project.  
COCOMO is an algorithmic approach to estimating the cost of software development.  
It is based on a set of basic software development effort equations, each with a set of multipliers that are used to adjust the effort for the project under consideration.
